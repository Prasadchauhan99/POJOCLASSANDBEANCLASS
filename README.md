What is a POJO?
A POJO (Plain Old Java Object) is a simple Java object with no restrictions other than being a valid Java class. It is used to represent data and has minimal design or structural constraints.

Characteristics of a POJO:
Plain Java: It is a normal class without any special requirements, annotations, or dependencies.
Fields and Methods:
Contains private fields (properties) to hold data.
Provides public getter and setter methods for accessing and modifying these fields.
No Inheritance Requirements: It doesn’t need to extend or implement any specific classes or interfaces.
No Heavy Constraints:
No specific annotations like @Entity, @Bean.
No special frameworks or libraries required.



What is a JavaBean?
A JavaBean is a specialized type of POJO that adheres to specific conventions and is used in Java frameworks like Spring, JSP, and Java EE. It’s essentially a POJO with stricter rules.

Characteristics of a JavaBean:
Serializable: Implements the java.io.Serializable interface so the state of the object can be saved and restored.
Private Fields: All properties (fields) must be private.
Public Getters and Setters: Provides public getter and setter methods for accessing and modifying fields.
No-Argument Constructor: Must have a public no-argument constructor to allow frameworks and tools to instantiate the bean.



Key Differences Between POJO and Bean
Aspect	POJO	JavaBean
Definition	A simple Java object.	A POJO with stricter rules.
Serializable	Not mandatory.	Must implement Serializable.
Constructor	Can have any constructor.	Requires a no-argument constructor.
Fields	Can be public, protected, or private.	Must be private (use getters/setters).
Framework Support	General-purpose.	Specifically used in Java frameworks.
Naming Conventions	No strict requirements for method names.	Follows getter and setter naming rules.




POJO Class and Bean Class in Java
POJO (Plain Old Java Object) and JavaBean are both common patterns used in Java programming for creating reusable, modular, and maintainable code. Although they share similarities, they have distinct characteristics and purposes.

No Inheritance Requirements: It doesn’t need to extend or implement any specific classes or interfaces.

Example of a POJO Class:
java
Copy code
public class Student {
    private int rollNumber;
    private String name;

    // Getter and Setter for rollNumber
    public int getRollNumber() {
        return rollNumber;
    }

    public void setRollNumber(int rollNumber) {
        this.rollNumber = rollNumber;
    }

    // Getter and Setter for name
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}

No-Argument Constructor: Must have a public no-argument constructor to allow frameworks and tools to instantiate the bean.
Example of a JavaBean Class:
java
Copy code
import java.io.Serializable;

public class Employee implements Serializable {
    private int id;
    private String name;
    private double salary;

    // No-argument constructor
    public Employee() {}

    // Getter and Setter for id
    public int getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public void setId(int id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    // Getter and Setter for name
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    // Getter and Setter for salary
    public double getSalary() {
        return salary;
    }

    public void setSalary(double salary) {
        this.salary = salary;
    }
}

When to Use POJO or JavaBean
POJO:

When you need a simple class to hold data without additional constraints.
Suitable for lightweight applications and situations where no frameworks are involved.
JavaBean:

When you are working with frameworks or tools that rely on the JavaBean conventions (e.g., Spring, JSP, Java EE).
Ideal for enterprise-level applications where serialization and specific design patterns are important.



Conclusion
All JavaBeans are POJOs, but not all POJOs are JavaBeans.
POJOs are more flexible and are used in a variety of contexts.
JavaBeans are tailored for use in larger, enterprise-level systems and adhere to strict conventions.
